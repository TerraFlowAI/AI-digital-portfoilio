## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Vivid orange (#FF7A00) to convey energy, innovation, and a modern outlook, aligning with the cutting-edge tech and design landscape. Avoids cliche color choices.
- Background color: Light gray (#EBE5DE), a desaturated hue of the primary orange, to maintain a soft and unobtrusive backdrop.
- Accent color: Yellow-orange (#FFA500), an analogous color to the primary, that provides a bright and contrasting highlight for key UI elements like buttons and active states.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif typeface for its modern, neutral appearance.
- Use a consistent set of minimalist icons (preferably from Lucide) to represent different contact methods and social media platforms.
- Maintain a clean, grid-based layout that ensures information is easily digestible, reflecting a professional design portfolio aesthetic.
- Implement subtle, tasteful transitions and hover effects to provide feedback and enhance user interaction, like a smooth color change or slight scaling on interactive elements.
